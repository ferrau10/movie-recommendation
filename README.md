Movie Recommender 
### add a gif of our website here###

A website to recommend movies based on user input

A non-negative Matrix Factorization based model recommends movies based on unlimited ratings of movies done by the user. 
On the main page, the user is randomly shown 16 of the 200 most rated movies from our database. 
They can rate those 16 movies if they have already seen, and based on their ratings, we recommend 3 top movies.

The user input is then saved to our database and the NMF model can be retrained.

Developed in Week 10 of the Spiced-Bootcamp using Python, Flask, Postgres, HTML, CSS, and using the ImdB api. 

This is a cooperation between Aurelie Ferron and Marcus
